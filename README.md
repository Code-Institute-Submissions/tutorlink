# User Centric Frontend Development Project - Tutorlink

<!-- One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. -->

<!-- Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. -->
Welcome to [TutorLink](https://jerhabor.github.io/tutorlink/index.html)!

This website was created for parents & guardians who are in search of a private tutor for their children, as well as students themselves who are well-versed in using technological devices to access and use this site to book a tutor. The site also promotes an opportunity for aspiring tutors to join and share their wealth of knowledge to those in need. 

Following the news of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has since been a strain on family members having to perform home-schooling duties for those still in school. TutorLink offers users the opportunity to alleviate this pressure by hiring a qualified tutor to guide their students to academic excellence. The key benefit of this, is that all sessions can take place in the comfort of their own homes. 

Currently, online sessions are strongly recommended for safety reasons. It is without a doubt a growing market thanks to the advancement of technology to this present day. The aim of the site is to connect students to tutors. The online sessions will take place via the video conferencing application, "Zoom". The times and dates of the sessions can be settled in advance by email or text between both the student and the tutor.  This provides flexibility for both parties as lives adjust to the new normal. 

## UX
 
<!-- Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. -->
The idea of creating a platform to encourage further learning has always been one of my goals. In this case, this site was built to enable the experienced to share and the students to learn at greater depths than they normally would in school. This means that tutors will be able to provide mentorship to students and coach them through their academic journey. To illustrate the connection that this site brings between tutors and students, the name "TutorLink" was therefore birthed (credits to my mother). 

The primary target audience are:
* Students
* Parents / Guardians who will sign up on behalf of their children

The secondary target audience are aspiring tutors.

TutorLink comprises of four pages, namely: 
* [Home](https://jerhabor.github.io/tutorlink/index.html) 
* [Tutors](https://jerhabor.github.io/tutorlink/tutors.html) 
* [Subjects](https://jerhabor.github.io/tutorlink/subjects.html)
* [Contact](https://jerhabor.github.io/tutorlink/contact.html)

<!-- In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal. -->

### User Stories

As part of the Stategy stage in the five planes of UX, I deemed it necessary to undertake a strategic research process. This involved asking several people what they would expect from a website which will realise the goals and dreams of "TutorLink". The target audience came with the following suggestions:

> As a GCSE student, I would like the website to be easy to navigate so that I can see what it offers as quickly as possible.

> As a tutor, I would love to see testimonials from people who have used been taught by us as this will help me in promoting it to other people.

> As a parent of both KS2 and 11+ students, I want to be able to sign up easily so that once I decide to do so, it is quickly over and done with.

> As an A-Level student, there should be the option to choose between face-to-face and virtual tutoring.

> As a parent of an 11+ student, I want your site to convince and reassure me in numerous ways why I should sign up.

> As an A-Level student, I would like to see the full list of tutors so that I can familiarise myself with my chosen tutor's background beforehand.

> As a GCSE student, Link subjects to any recommended revision material so that students can obtain them prior to the first session.


<!-- This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. -->
The above user requirements were aligned with the stategies of TutorLink in order to establish the project scope. This was predominantly a brainstorming activity to propose and develop initial creative solutions. Once I had consulted with my mentor and defined an initial scope, I then drafted up wireframes for the website in both desktop and mobile versions as well as a moodboard for potential elements and characteristics of the site. You can find the initial development notes [here](https://github.com/jerhabor/tutorlink/tree/master/assets/project-development).

<!-- For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional. -->

<!-- In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future: -->

### Features Left to Implement
<!-- - Another feature idea -->

## Technologies Used

<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used. -->

<!-- - [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. -->


## Testing

<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals. -->

<!-- Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them. -->

<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as: -->

<!-- 1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears. -->

<!-- In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. -->

<!-- You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet. -->

<!-- If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

## Deployment

<!-- This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku). -->

<!-- In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch? -->

<!-- In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally. -->
